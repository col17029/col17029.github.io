A promise represents the future result of an asynchronous operation. Promises don't do anything that can't already be achieved <br>
using callbacks, but they help simplify the process, and avoid the convoluted code that can result from using multiple callbacks.<br>
<br>
Resolved ― the asynchronous operation was completed successfully.<br>
<br>
Rejected ― the asynchronous operation didn’t work as expected, wasn't successfully completed or resulted in an error.<br>
<br>
const promise = new Promise( (resolve, reject) => {<br>
    // initialization code goes here<br>
    if (success) {<br>
        resolve(value);<br>
    } else {<br>
        reject(error);<br>
    }<br>
});<br>

fetch:<br>
fetch('https://example.com/data')<br>
.then( // code that handles the response )<br>
.catch( // code that runs if the server returns an error )<br>
<br>
redirect:<br>
fetch(url)<br>
.then( response => response.redirect(newURL)); // redirects to another URL<br>
.then( // do something else )<br>
.catch( error => console.log('There was an error: ', error))<br>

Request Interface<br>
We can get more fine-grained control over the request being made by providing a Request object as an argument.<br>
This allows a number of options to be set about the request.<br>
<br>
Request objects are created using the Request() constructor, and include the following properties:<br>
<br>
 url – The URL of the requested resource (the only property that is required).<br>
 method – a string that specifies which HTTP method should be used for the request. By default, this is 'GET'.<br>
 headers – This is a Headers object (see later section) that provides details of the request's headers.<br>
 mode – Allows you to specify if CORS is used or not. CORS is enabled by default.<br>
 cache – Allows you to specify how the request will use the browser's cache. For example, you can force it to request<br>
 a resource and update the cache with the result, or you can force it to only look in the cache for the resource.<br>
 credentials – Lets you specify if cookies should be allowed with the request.<br>
 redirect – Specifies what to do if the response returns a redirect. There’s a choice of three values: 'follow' (the redirect is followed),<br>
 'error' (an error is thrown) or 'manual' (the user has to click on a link to follow the redirect).<br>
