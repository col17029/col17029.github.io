Exception - produces return value to help with troubleshooting.

Stack Trace - Give sequence from error back to help trace down the issue.

Warning - code keeps going but something is wrong.

Fail loudly in developement, gracefully in production.

'use strict'; //to enable strict mode

function strictly(){
    'use strict';
    // function code goes here, for strict mode by function.

Linting tools will look for sloppy code and enforcing programming style guides.

Feature detection =
Modernizr
Can I use?

alert() or console.log()   // will display results

console.trace()  //logs a stack trace to the console.

try, catch, and finally:
function imaginarySquareRoot(number) {
    'use strict';
    try {
        return String(squareRoot(number));
    } catch(error) {
        return squareRoot(-number)+'i';
    }
}

TDD - Test drive developement //writing tests before coding.
Write tests (that initially fail)

Write code to pass the tests

Refactor the code

Test refactored code

Write more tests for new features
