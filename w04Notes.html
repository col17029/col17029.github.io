Some common types of form control are:<br>
    -input- fields, including text, passwords, check boxes, radio buttons, and file uploads<br>
    -select- menus for drop-down lists of options<br>
    -textarea- elements for longer text entry<br>
    -button- elements for submitting and resetting forms<br>
</p>
<p>
- document.forms will return an HTML collection of all the forms on a page.
- form.elements will return an HTML collection of all the elements contained within a form.
- Forms have focus , blur , and change events that fire as a user interacts with the form.
- Forms also have a submit event that can be used to intercept a form before itâ€™s been submitted.
- The information entered into a form can be read or updated using the value property of the form controls.

Questions:
   <p> 1. I don't understand the difference between literals and constructors.  
        It seems easier to build an array as a literal but also is recommended. </p>
  <p>  2. I'm not sure I understand how to build constructor functions.  It is confusing enough to read through it
        to determine what it is doing, let alone understanding what needs to be put in place to build one.</p>
  <p>  3. class Turtle {
        constructor(name,color) {
            this.name = name;
            let _color = color;
            this.setColor = color => { return _color = color; }
            this.getColor = () => _color;
        }
    }   // Why are we declaring _color = color twice?  
</p>

Notes:
A golden rule to remember is:Never use arrays or objects as a default value in prototype.
</p><p>
Inside the child class declaration, the keyword super refers to the parent class, and can be used to access any properties and call any methods of the parent class
